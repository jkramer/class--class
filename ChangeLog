	* t/02simple.t, lib/Class/Class.pm: Support globs.

1999-12-15  B. K. Oxley (binkley) at Work  <binkley@datacraft.com>

	* t/02simple.t: Added tests for coderefs.

	* lib/Class/Class.pm: Added code refs.

	* lib/Class/Class.pm: Added add_method; update _make_methods to use it.

1999-12-14  B. K. Oxley (binkley) at Work  <binkley@datacraft.com>

	* t/01load.t, t/02simple.t, t/03complex.t, t/04polymorph.t, t/05polyvolve.t, lib/Class/Class.pm:
	Added smart DESTROY method to help with circular links (I hope!).

	* lib/Class/Class.pm: Don't shift the arg stack willy-nilly.

1999-12-03  B. K. Oxley (binkley) at Work  <binkley@datacraft.com>

	* MANIFEST: Added t/05polyvolve.t.

	* t/04polymorph.t, lib/Class/Class.pm:
	Fixed both semantics and performance of core of polymorph.
	Renamed _inited -> __inited and _polymorphed -> __tried_polymorph both
	to make it more clear they are internal, and to make their functionality
	less ambiguous.
	Improved 04polymorph.t.

	* lib/Class/Class.pm:
	Last version to use "use" and check %INC.  Next version will rely on
	Perl's builtin semantics for this so that we don't do the work twice.

1999-11-18  B. K. Oxley (binkley) at Work  <binkley@datacraft.com>

	* t/04polymorph.t, lib/Class/Class.pm:
	Caught top-level package case ("::TopLevelPack").
	Improved polymorph tests.

	* lib/Class/Class.pm: Use hash, not list, for build methods -- duh!

1999-11-03  B. K. Oxley (binkley) at Work  <binkley@datacraft.com>

	* t/05polyvolve.t, lib/Class/Class.pm:
	Can now polyvolve = many evolve (polymorph until it works).

	* t/02simple.t, lib/Class/Class.pm, MANIFEST, Makefile.PL:
	Pseudo-documented; polymorph seems to work, but I don't trust it yet.

1999-09-17  B. K. Oxley (binkley) at Work  <binkley@datacraft.com>

	* lib/Class/Class.pm:
	Use our own __DIE__ handler in case someone else has installed one
	ahead of use.

	* t/03complex.t, t/04polymorph.t, lib/Class/Class.pm:
	Fixed polymorph bug... ugh.  Need to think more about init ordering.

1999-09-16  B. K. Oxley (binkley) at Work  <binkley@datacraft.com>

	* t/03complex.t, t/04polymorph.t, lib/Class/Class.pm:
	Test suite!  Work on polymorph bug.

	* lib/Class/Class.pm:
	Fixed bug with autonewed objects (new $value v. $value->new).

	* lib/Class/Class.pm:
	Fixed problem with versioning.  How do you prepend a version # to
	the RCS number, e.g., 0.$Revision: 1.2 $?

	* t/01load.t, t/02simple.t, t/03complex.t, t/load.t, lib/Class/Class.pm, MANIFEST:
	Test suite -- caught obscure bug with object members.

1999-09-14  B. K. Oxley (binkley) at Work  <binkley@datacraft.com>

	* ChangeLog, MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, README, TODO, lib/Class/Class.pm, t/load.t:
	Break out non-OMD2 code for reuseability.

	* ChangeLog, MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, README, TODO, lib/Class/Class.pm, t/load.t:
	New file.
